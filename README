This is my growing archive of boot splash zip file for use on the Note 5.

For use on rooted phones.

just reboot into recovery and install the zip in your preferred recovery platform.

******** I claim no responsibility if you brick your phone.***********

I have tested them on my SM-N920T.

I will continue to update the archive as frequently as i can.

all files mase with GIMP and rezipped with engrampa archiver.

All logo.jpg files are 1440x2560 and are all under the required 120kb file limit.
